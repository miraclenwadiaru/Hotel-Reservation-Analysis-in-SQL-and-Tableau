# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-in-SQL-and-Tableau

## Overview

This is the second project in FLIT apprenticeship projectized learning. The dataset used is hotel reservation data. It contains information about reservations at two types of hotels: resort hotels and city hotels. The goal is to explore the dataset, identify interesting patterns, and create impactful visualizations to tell a compelling story. In this project, I used MySQL for analysis and Tableau for visualization. By combining the power of a relational database with robust visualization capabilities, this analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the hotel reservation system.

# Steps

## Data Import and Data Exploration
I created a database to import the data. Explore the dataset to understand its characteristics, identify any anomalies, and ensure data quality. Utilize SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the database. Analyze booking patterns, customer demographics, popular room types, and revenue generation.
## Tableau Visualization 
I created an interactive and insightful visualization using Tableau.

# Recommendations

* I recommend that the hotel recognize August as a period were the demand is high and adequately prepare for it by ensuring sufficient staff, stock, and operational capacity to accommodate the guests.

* Encourage early bookings by offering incentives such as discounted rates, room upgrades, or complimentary services for guests who book in advance.

* Pay close attention to reviews from customers residing in Portugal, the UK, and France. Use this feedback to improve customer service.

* I recommend that the hotel utilize online advertising and social media campaigns to gain visibility in countries with low bookings.

* There should be enhanced communication with guests who have booked but are at risk of canceling. Provide discounts or incentives to encourage them to retain their reservations.
